    "## Analysis – Model Comparison (gpt-4o-mini vs gpt-4o vs gpt-4.1-mini)\n",
    "\n",
    "From the previous block, we observed:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Latency and tokens\n",
    "\n",
    "- `gpt-4o-mini`: ~4.1s, 162 tokens (34 in, 128 out)  \n",
    "- `gpt-4o`: ~3.0s, 140 tokens (34 in, 106 out)  \n",
    "- `gpt-4.1-mini`: ~2.9s, 141 tokens (34 in, 107 out)\n",
    "\n",
    "Key takeaways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- In a single run, the “mini” model was not the fastest.  \n",
    "  - Network variance and model warm-up can dominate latency in isolated tests.  \n",
    "- `gpt-4o-mini` produced the **longest output**, which increases both cost and time.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Style and quality\n",
    "\n",
    "- All three models produced high-quality, coherent descriptions.  \n",
    "- `gpt-4o-mini`:\n",
    "  - More verbose and highly sensory\n",
    "  - Slightly more repetitive in expressing comfort and warmth  \n",
    "- `gpt-4o`:\n",
    "  - More concise and balanced\n",
    "  - Feels editorial and polished  \n",
    "- `gpt-4.1-mini`:\n",
    "  - Similar to gpt-4o, slightly more formal\n",
    "  - Strong imagery without becoming overly long  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "- For this type of descriptive writing, all models are “good enough”.  \n",
    "- The main differences are:\n",
    "  - length of the response  \n",
    "  - subtle stylistic preferences  \n",
    "  - small latency variations  \n",
    "\n",
    "This block shows that **model choice is not only about raw “intelligence”**, but about the trade-off between:\n",
    "\n",
    "- quality  \n",
    "- cost  \n",
    "- latency  \n",
    "- verbosity  \n",
    "\n",
    "In future projects, this intuition will be important when choosing which model to use for:\n",
    "- agents  \n",
    "- RAG pipelines  \n",
    "- user-facing UI responses  \n",
    "- high-volume workloads\n"
