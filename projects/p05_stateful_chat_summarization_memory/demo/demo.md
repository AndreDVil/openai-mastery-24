Demo — Project 05

The demo is a minimal CLI chat loop demonstrating:

- accumulation of recent messages
- automatic memory summarization
- state rewrite under overflow and safety triggers
- transparent debug output

The demo intentionally avoids UI, persistence, or tooling
to keep focus on memory behavior and system design.
