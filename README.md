# 🚀 openai-mastery-24  
### *A 24-project journey to master Applied AI Engineering with OpenAI*

This repository documents a complete, structured path to becoming a **professional AI Engineer** through 24 progressive projects that cover every modern capability of OpenAI models and APIs.

The program combines:

- software engineering  
- AI engineering  
- architectural best practices  
- reproducible demos  
- documentation discipline  
- real-world product thinking  

By the end, you will have built a **complete, senior-level portfolio** including agents, advanced RAG, multimodal apps, orchestration, automation, Realtime API, and a final autonomous multi-agent “Life OS.”

# 🧭 Purpose

The main goal of *openai-mastery-24* is:

> **To build, through practice, a complete and industry-ready AI Engineering skillset**, covering chat, memory, embeddings, RAG, tool calling, agents, workflows, multimodality, automation, and product design.

Each project is:

- independent  
- located in its own directory  
- developed in a dedicated branch  
- merged via Pull Request  
- documented using standard guidelines  
- required to include a skills report and one or more demos  

See the headquarters document:

# 🏆 Certification of Progress

Project completion is formally recorded in:

➡️ **CERTIFICATE.md**

For each completed project:

- update status and date  
- add README link  
- add demo link  
- list key competencies gained  

This file serves as your **public proof of mastery**.

# 🧱 Global Standards

All projects must follow:

### ✔ Documentation Standards  
- English only  
- 8-section README template  
- clear architecture and examples  
- reproducible instructions  

### ✔ Demo Guidelines  
- at least one demo per project  
- notebook / CLI / screenshots / video  
- stored in the `/demo` directory  

### ✔ Git Workflow  
- `main` always stable  
- one branch per project (`projectXX`)  
- feature branches optional  
- mandatory PR with template  
- delete branches after merge  

### ✔ Definition of Done  
A project is only **DONE** when:  
- README completed  
- skills-report completed  
- demo provided  
- PR approved and merged  
- CERTIFICATE.md updated
