# openai-mastery-24

**openai-mastery-24** is a complete 24-project learning path designed to master:

- OpenAI’s entire API ecosystem (Chat, Tools, JSON, RAG, Embeddings, Vision, Audio)
- Agentic architectures (tool-using agents, multi-agent systems, planners, governance)
- Enterprise-grade Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Full AI product development (backend, frontend, deployment, observability)
- Autonomous AI systems

Each project includes:

1. **Project Case Study (README)**  
2. **Skills Report** documenting the competencies gained  
3. **Demo artifacts** (notebooks, apps, screenshots, videos)

This repository functions as both a **portfolio** and a **living certification** of AI engineering expertise.
