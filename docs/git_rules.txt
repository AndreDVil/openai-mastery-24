# Git Rules – openai-mastery-24
# Purpose:
#   This document defines the Git workflow and conventions used in the
#   openai-mastery-24 repository. The goal is to practice professional-level
#   Git habits while building the 24 OpenAI/AI projects.

==================================================
1. GENERAL PRINCIPLES
==================================================

- The `main` branch must always be:
  - stable
  - deployable / demo-ready
  - never broken by half-done experiments

- No direct commits to `main`.
  - All changes go through branches + Pull Request (PR).

- Every project (00–24) and every relevant feature should have its own branch.

- Think like a team, even if the project is personal:
  - small, focused branches
  - clear commits
  - documented PRs
  - readable history


==================================================
2. BRANCH STRATEGY
==================================================

2.1. Main branch

- Name: `main`
- Role:
  - Holds the "official" version of the repository.
  - Must be protected in GitHub:
    - no direct pushes
    - merge via Pull Request only

- Contents:
  - Completed and reviewed project modules
  - Stable documentation

--------------------------------------------------

2.2. Project branches

- Pattern:
  - `projectXX`
  - where `XX` is a zero-padded project number (00, 01, 02, …, 24)

- Examples:
  - `project00`
  - `project01`
  - `project10`

- Usage:
  - One branch per project, used as the "main working branch" for that project.
  - All features for that project branch out from here when necessary.

--------------------------------------------------

2.3. Feature branches (inside a project)

- Pattern:
  - `projectXX/feature-<short-name>`

- Examples:
  - `project00/feature-notebook-foundations`
  - `project00/feature-cost-analysis`
  - `project01/feature-cli-chat`
  - `project10/feature-rag-indexing`

- Usage:
  - Used for specific pieces of work inside a project.
  - Helps keep PRs small and focused.

--------------------------------------------------

2.4. Sub-feature branches (optional, for complex work)

- Pattern:
  - `projectXX/feature-<short-name>/sub-<subname>`

- Examples:
  - `project00/feature-cost-analysis/sub-refactor-token-pricing`
  - `project14/feature-multiagent/sub-planning-loop`

- Usage:
  - Use when a feature is large enough to be split into smaller steps.
  - Not mandatory, but allowed when it helps organization.


==================================================
3. BRANCH WORKFLOW
==================================================

3.1. Starting a new project

- Always create a new branch before starting:

  Example for Project 01:
    git checkout main
    git pull origin main
    git checkout -b project01

- All work related to that project starts from `project01`.

--------------------------------------------------

3.2. Starting a new feature inside a project

- From the project branch:

    git checkout project01
    git pull origin project01
    git checkout -b project01/feature-basic-chat-cli

- Implement feature, commit changes, push branch:

    git add .
    git commit -m "feat: add basic chat CLI for project01"
    git push -u origin project01/feature-basic-chat-cli

- Open a Pull Request:
  - Base: `project01`
  - Compare: `project01/feature-basic-chat-cli`

- After review (by you) and tests, merge PR into `project01`.

--------------------------------------------------

3.3. Merging a project into main

- When a project reaches a stable milestone (e.g., first complete version):

  1. Ensure `projectXX` is up-to-date with `main`:
       git checkout projectXX
       git pull origin projectXX
       git checkout main
       git pull origin main
       git checkout projectXX
       git merge main   # resolve conflicts if needed

  2. Push updated `projectXX` branch:
       git push origin projectXX

  3. Open PR:
     - Base: `main`
     - Compare: `projectXX`
     - Title: `Project XX – <short summary>`

  4. Review, approve, merge.
  5. Optionally delete branch `projectXX` after merge:
       git branch -d projectXX
       git push origin --delete projectXX

==================================================
4. COMMIT MESSAGE CONVENTIONS
==================================================

- Use short, descriptive messages with a type prefix:

Common prefixes:
  - feat:   new feature
  - fix:    bug fix
  - docs:   documentation changes
  - refactor: code restructuring
  - chore:  maintenance, config, tooling
  - test:   add or update tests

Examples:
  - feat: add foundations notebook for project00
  - docs: document temperature vs top_p behavior
  - fix: correct latency calculation for model comparison
  - refactor: extract cost estimation helper function


==================================================
5. PULL REQUEST (PR) PRACTICES
==================================================

5.1. General rules

- Every change that affects `main` must go through a PR.
- Ideal PR size:
  - small and focused
  - one logical change per PR whenever possible

- Suggested PR sections:
  - What was done
  - Why this matters (link to projectXX)
  - How to test
  - Screenshots or logs (if relevant)
  - Checklist

--------------------------------------------------

5.2. PR Template (suggested content)

Create `.github/pull_request_template.md` with:

  # What was done
  (Brief description of the changes)

  # Why this change is important
  (Link to projectXX and explain what was learned technically)

  # How to test
  (Steps or commands to reproduce and validate)

  # Checklist
  - [ ] Code runs locally
  - [ ] Notebook(s) updated (if applicable)
  - [ ] Docs updated (if applicable)
  - [ ] No direct commits to main

==================================================
6. LABELS (ORGANIZATION)
==================================================

6.1. Project labels

- Used to tag PRs/issues by project:

  - project00
  - project01
  - ...
  - project24

6.2. Type labels

- To identify the nature of the change:

  - feature
  - bugfix
  - docs
  - refactor
  - experiment
  - infra

6.3. Priority labels (optional)

  - priority:high
  - priority:medium
  - priority:low

6.4. Status labels (optional)

  - status:wip      (work in progress)
  - status:ready    (ready for review)
  - status:blocked  (waiting on something)

Using labels makes it easy to:
  - filter PRs per project
  - track progress
  - review history later


==================================================
7. BRANCH PROTECTION RULES (GITHUB)
==================================================

Recommended settings for `main`:

- Protect `main` branch
  - Require pull request before merging
  - Disallow direct pushes
  - Disallow force pushes
  - Optionally: require at least 1 review
  - Optionally: require that branch is up-to-date before merging

Goal:
  - Prevent accidental breakage of `main`
  - Enforce the habit of working via branches + PRs


==================================================
8. PRACTICAL GUIDELINES
==================================================

- Before starting new work:
  - Always check which branch you are on:
      git status
  - If on `main`, create a new branch before editing anything.

- Never:
  - Commit directly to `main`.
  - Force-push to `main`.

- Always:
  - Use branches for new work.
  - Open PRs and write at least a small explanation.
  - Keep commits relatively small and meaningful.

- Remember:
  - This repository is also a training ground for professional Git practices.
  - The goal is not only OpenAI mastery, but also disciplined engineering workflow.
