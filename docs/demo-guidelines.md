# Demo Guidelines – openai-mastery-24

Each project must include at least one demo format:

- Jupyter notebook  
- CLI script  
- Streamlit app  
- Screenshot sequence  
- Short video (30–60 seconds)

Place demos inside the `demo/` folder of each project.

Recommended filenames:
- `demo-notebook.ipynb`
- `demo-cli.gif`
- `demo-screenshots.md`
- `demo-video.md`
