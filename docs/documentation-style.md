# Documentation Style Guide – openai-mastery-24

This repository uses a **hybrid writing style**:

- Professional and technically correct  
- Clear and accessible  
- Focused on practical relevance

## Principles

1. **Clarity first**  
2. **Context before details**  
3. **Show, don’t tell**  
4. **Real-world implications**  
5. **Useful repetition for reinforcement**

3. OpenAI features explored  
4. Architecture  
5. How to run the demo  
6. Results & examples

Each README must clearly state:
